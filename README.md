## About the Project

This project was developed as part of a **challenge proposed by professor Alan Gomes**, carried out in **pair programming** by **Luiz Paulo Hondo** and **Mayza Ynara**.

The goal was to implement features in **JavaScript**, following the **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** methodology, ensuring greater reliability, maintainability, and clarity in the code.

---

## Technologies Used

* **JavaScript** ‚Äì Main logic and implementation.
* **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** ‚Äì Test-oriented development.
* **Jest** ‚Äì Unit testing framework.
* **Git/GitHub** ‚Äì Version control and team collaboration.
* **Prettier & ESLint** ‚Äì Code formatting and best practices.

---

## Challenge Goals

* Practice programming logic with **JavaScript**.
* Apply **TDD** as a development practice.
* Work as a team using **pair programming**.
* Practice collaborative version control on **GitHub**.

## How to Run the Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MayzaMendesRodrigues/bananaChallenge-01.git
cd bananaChallenge-01

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test
```

---

## Tests

The project was developed with **Jest** from the start, following the **TDD** methodology.
To run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```

---

## Learnings

During the development of this challenge, the main learnings were:

* The importance of writing tests before implementation.
* How **TDD** helps create cleaner and more modular code.
* Benefits of **pair programming**, with real-time idea exchange.

---

## Future Improvements

* Expand automated test coverage.
* Refactor functions for greater reusability.
* Add CI integration (GitHub Actions).
